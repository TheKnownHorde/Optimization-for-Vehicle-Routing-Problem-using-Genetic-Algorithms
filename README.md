# Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
This project focuses on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations, minimizing the total travel distance and balancing the workload among vehicles.

## Introduction
The Vehicle Routing Problem is a critical issue in logistics and supply chain management. Optimizing delivery routes can lead to significant cost savings and improved service levels. In this project, we leverage Genetic Algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to the VRP by simulating the process of natural selection.

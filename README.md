# Optimization-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithms
A Genetic Algorithm-based solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that optimizes delivery routes for multiple vehicles. The project balances workload and minimizes total travel distance using evolutionary computation techniques.

# Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
This project focuses on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations, minimizing the total travel distance and balancing the workload among vehicles.

## Introduction
The Vehicle Routing Problem is a critical issue in logistics and supply chain management. Optimizing delivery routes can lead to significant cost savings and improved service levels. In this project, we leverage Genetic Algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to the VRP by simulating the process of natural selection.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `deap`
  
## Usage

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-routing-genetic-algorithm.git
cd vehicle-routing-genetic-algorithm

## Genetic Algorithm Approach
This project employs the following steps to solve the VRP:

Population Initialization: Individuals represent a permutation of location indices, defining the order in which vehicles will visit the locations.
Fitness Function: The fitness function evaluates each individual based on the total travel distance and the balance of the workload among vehicles.

Genetic Operators:
Selection: Tournament selection is used to select individuals for reproduction.
Crossover: Partially Matched Crossover (PMX) is employed to exchange genetic material between pairs of individuals.
Mutation: Mutation is performed by shuffling the indices of locations with a low probability.
Evolution Process:The algorithm iteratively improves the population by applying selection, crossover, and mutation until a stopping condition is met.
